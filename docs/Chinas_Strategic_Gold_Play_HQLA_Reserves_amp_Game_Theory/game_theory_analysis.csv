Game Theory Model,Application to Gold,Predicted Outcome 2025-2030
Coordination Game,Central banks coordinate on gold as reserve asset,Increased global convergence on gold
Nash Equilibrium,Each bank's optimal strategy: buy gold if others buy gold,Self-reinforcing feedback loop continues
First-Mover Advantage,"Early buyers (China, Russia, Poland) gain at lower prices",Late movers pay higher entry prices
Network Effects,"As more CBs buy, gold becomes more legitimate reserve",Gold share in reserves rises to 20-25% globally
Prisoner's Dilemma (Modified),Cooperation (buying gold together) > Defection (staying in USD),Gold strengthens as sanctions hedge
