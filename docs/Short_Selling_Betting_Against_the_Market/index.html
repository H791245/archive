                <p class="intro-text">
                    Imagine making billions when everyone else is losing money. Short selling is a strategy where investors profit from declining prices. 
                    While most people buy low and sell high, short sellers do the opposite‚Äîthey sell high first, then buy low later. 
                    Let's explore how legendary traders like Scott Bessent used this strategy to make fortunes.

                    <h3>Risk Management</h3>
                    <p>Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Short selling has unlimited potential losses if prices rise instead of fall.</p>

                    <h3>Patience</h3>
                    <p>Wait for the right opportunities, don't force trades. Michael Burry waited years for his housing bet to pay off.</p>

                    <h3>Conviction</h3>

                    <p>Short selling is extremely risky and not suitable for most investors. When you buy a stock, the most you can lose is 100% of your investment. When you short a stock, potential losses are unlimited because prices can theoretically rise infinitely.
